# Automatic File Sorter (Practice project)
This is a small Python project mainly for practice, in which I define a function that automatically sort various file types into their corresponding category folders. It is a part of our Python for Beginner Challenge held by the Mentor and Supporters of the Self-study Data Discord community, with support from Sir Alex Freberg (CEO of Analyst Builder).

**The requirements for this project are as follows:**  
You will earn bonus points based on the number of different file types you can correctly sort into separate folders. The more file types you can handle, the higher your score.

For example:  
If you can sort images, documents, and videos into separate folders, you'll earn 1 bonus point. However, if you can additionally sort compressed files, audio files, and executable files, etc., you'll earn 3 bonus points for the challenge.

**Aside from the requirements above, I also added a rename feature to my function, which will change the file's name in case it detects a file with the same name in the destination folder, so that the file could still be moved to its corresponding folder succesfully.**
